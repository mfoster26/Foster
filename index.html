                <h2>A Little About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    I grew up in Southeast Iowa, youngest of four brothers. I currently attend Winona State University as part of the I-Design Program, with a concentration in Conceptual Illustration. 
                    I have a passion for sharing the Gospel, longboarding, film photography, and consuming caffeine through coffee.
                    With my concentration being Conceptual Illustration, I'm exploring the creative avenue of designing book covers for authors of fantasy novels. Overall, I hope to travel the world as
                    a digital nomad, working freelance, while also sharing the Gospel in any way I can, and also seeking to support local churches wherever I find myself.

                <h2>My Goals for this Course</h2>
                Although my focus is on book cover illustration, I want to widen my skill set to help me become more versatile and desirable as a freelancer. I hope my heart posture toward this course is 
                to consistently learn to love learning, especially the aspects I find more challenging. May I never lose my wonder, and I hope my discipline grows as I dive deep into learning web design.
